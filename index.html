                <h1>Something about me</h1>
                <p>I was born in Riga, in 1990, and all my life I live here and don’t want to change living place.</p>
                <p>In my early 30th years, I decided to change not only job, but profession, because my previous job didn’t gave me any satisfaction.
                    Why I choose exactly it WEB-development? I just sow on YouTube some video about how WEB-page was made, and I really liked the idea, that basically, you made a WEB-“painting” using only words and numbers, and I liked this idea and I want to move in that direction,
                    of course after the course start I realised that there is some others thing which you need to learn, but that okay.</p> 
                <p>What else I can say, according to the horoscope I’m Aquarius, and I don’t know if this information will have some meaning here. 
                    My mom said, that I’m most beautiful boy in the world, but I have brother who is married, so obviously she lied to one of us, and i know for sure, it was me me.
                    Information about my hobbies, education and work experience you will see bellow.</p>

                <h4>Reading</h4>
                <p>I like reading, but unfortunately right now I don’t have much time
                  to read. And I didn’t like to read in childhood not even in the
                  school, and I’m really regret it right now. I don’t have any
                  literary genre which I prefer. I can read everything what I think I
                  will like, from some love romance to books 
                </p>

                <h4>Hiking</h4>
                <p>I find out about hiking about 2 years ago, when pandemic started, because it was only
                  way to do something interesting while you are on vacation and you can’t go nowhere.
                  And after that it begun to be my hobby. Some of my friends say that I’m idiot, 
                  but I get satisfaction after walking 30 km in winter forest through the swamps,
                  and you get really tired, but still you are very happy after this journey.
                </p>

              <div class="hobbies_text" >
                <h4>Running</h4>
                <p>With running I have the same story like with hiking. In pandemic all gyms was closed and I needed some 
                  activity after work, and running was only activity which you could do without any restriction.
                  And after 2 years of running in May I run my first marathon.

                <h4>Movies</h4>
                <p>I can’t say that I watching all movies which are coming out today, mostly I prefer watching classic movies, 
                  and right now I like watching movies about samurai, especially Akira Kurosawa movies,
                  like “Seven samurai”, “Rashamon”, “Yojimbo”.
